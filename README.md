## A* Path-Finding Algorithm

The A* Path-finding algorithm (herefrom referenced to as the A* Algorithm) is a searching algorithm which searches for and determines the
shortest possible path between two nodes. Since this is an informed search algorithm, it uses externally calculated data (in this case, its
heuristic function) to approximate the distance between the current and end node - allowing it to significantly reduce the space searched and
considered, in comparison to a more uninformed 'brute force' approach. This factor makes the A* Algorithm quicker to run compared to uninformed
search algorithms such as Depth and Breadth-First Search.
